# Fluent Trivia

Thanks for the opportunity to complete the interview.

## Stack
- *React*
- *Express*
- *MongoDB*
- *Typescript*

## Future Improvements
- The OpenTrivia API returns question and answer text with HTML character encodings which should be displayed as their respective characters.
- Improve POC UI layout and elements.
- Gracefully handle reaching the end of questions in category set.

## Learnings & Successes
- This project has been useful practice for the class I'm teaching this quarter, and experimenting has been enormously helpful.
- I'd never used Typescript for React or Express before, which made this a fun challenge.
- I've tried using both hooks and a class component for stateful components in the client app, which is something I've struggled with in the past. 
- The patterns my team uses at Nordstrom have given me a good starting point for code organization.
