# Fluent Trivia

## Stack
- *React*
- *Express*
- *MongoDB*
- *Typescript*

## Known Issues
- The OpenTrivia API returns question and answer text with HTML character encodings, which I have not yet found a simple way of decoding.
- UI is not a strong suit, and the obvious lack of refinement is a reflection of that.

## Learnings & Successes
- I'd never used Typescript for React or Express before, and both are very pleasant.
- I've tried using both hooks and a class component for stateful components in the client app, which is something I've struggled with in the past. This project has been useful practice for the class I'm teaching this quarter, and experimenting has been enormously helpful.
- The patterns my team uses at Nordstrom have given me a good starting point for code organization here.
- While there are some places where best practices are unknown to me, I've written code that I feel good about.
