# Fluent Trivia

## Stack
- *React*
- *Express*
- *MongoDB*
- *Typescript*

## Known Issues
- The OpenTrivia API returns question and answer text with HTML character encodings, which I have not yet found a simple way of decoding.
- 

## Learnings
- I'd never used Typescript for React or Express before, and both are very pleasant.
- I've tried using both hooks and a class component for stateful components in the client app, which is something I've struggled with in the past. This project has been useful practice for the class I'm teaching this quarter, and experimenting has been enormously helpful.
